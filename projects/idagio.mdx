## Cultural Omnivores

For researchers who have been studying the classical music, this is not surprising. Despite their affection in classical music, even the most dedicated fans of the genre has been known to be listening to music outside of the classical genre . _Their diverse musical taste implies that iDAGIO cannot expect their audience to be solely engaging with their classical only platform._

## Enthusiast’s algorithm diet on the internet

On other online platforms, namely youtube and forms like reddit, the classical music enthusiasts continues to discover music on these venue despite iDAGIO’s offering. Other than being a product, they also offer distinctive values that iDAGIO’s playlist curation lacks — namely the network of the online enthusiast community.

-- This is a problem for iDAGIO: they loose brand control in the classical streaming space as the users discover music on other venues. When user revisit those discovery on the other platforms, it undermine iDAGIO’s ability to deliver value.

## Strategy

As demostrated above, iDAGIO need with co-exist with it's competitors.

This project propose a feature that funnel new discovery back to the iDAGIO eco-system. By establishing iDAGIO as the user’s classical music library, it create more sticky experience.

## Closing notes

This project was initially done as an experience design project in my senior years of university. Learnings from my product design internship make me see severe problems of the project, which ultimately led me rework a big chunk of it.

In this final iteration, the strategy and interaction design was refined by myself with the help of feedback from my friends.
