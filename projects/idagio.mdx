## The Contemporary Classical Music Audience

Classical music listeners often find their genre difficult to relate to in their daily social circle. As a participant in a focus group study mentioned:

"Think it would be quite difficult to talk about music to someone ...it’s uh so complex that I don’t know what you would really talk about to someone who has no understanding of classical music. You would have nowhere really to start to talk about a particular piece or anything so it would be quite difficult." (Crawford et al, 2014, p. 496)

And because of that, online forum become an outlet of their passion as they find like minded individuals of their niche genre. It has become the place where people from different levels of familiarity to the genre congregate.

## Discovery strikes at any moment
