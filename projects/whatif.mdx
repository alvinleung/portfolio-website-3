-- Hosted by fabrica, "What if?" is an interactive art installations exhibition featuring 12 budding international artists. Child of a deep experimentation process, this expressive microsite with unique interactions and visual identity archives the artists' provocative works on humanity's future.

## Celebrate the works

As an online archive for the installation art pieces, the microsite intends to encapsulate the physical experience of the exhibition by creating a sense of immersion for visitors. The following are the major design features of the microsite:

## Experimental Approach to Art Direction

Taking inspiration from Ellen Lupton, Woflgang Weingart and Chris Ashworth, the process began with a thorough investigation of a set of design principles and qualities.

## Towards an Interactive Identity

Driven by a process that focuses on creating tangible artifacts, we iteratively explored interaction and motion possibilities.

To begin, we formulate 3 initial lines of investigations to see what the art direction affords us:

<List>
  <ListItem label="I">Distortion as a way to guide visitor attention</ListItem>
  <ListItem label="II">
    Denial and reward through high effort interactions
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem label="III">
    Playing with distortion for personal expression
  </ListItem>
</List>

After collecting and curating an extensive list of distortion techniques, hover interactions, animations, navigation, and methods of implementing dynamic grids, three distinct approaches was emerged as a way to surface content through interactivity.

Seeing how they could potentially compliment each other, the three approaches are unified into one in the final microsite.
