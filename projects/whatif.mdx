## Interaction and Art Direction

We extended the existing TED branding expressive potential by introducing the “bloom” motion language. The gentle staggering motion was light and flowing, evokes motif of organic life.

Working with the marketing team, the strategy maintained across multiple communication channels. Through these external artifects, curious individuals who see the topic are encouraged to discover content on the website.

## Testing & Interation

Before development, we ran a formative user research session on the prototype with 6 SFU students. We also asked a middle aged parent with visual impairment to participate with the intent of stress testing the system usability.
