-- This senior art direction + interaction design project envisions an expressive post-event microsite for what if? — an exhibition hosted by Fabrica. Featuring interactive art installations from 12 international artists, the works capture daring speculations of humanity's future.

## Content Approach

Through interviewing stakeholders, we found that speakers and their topics are the major motivating factor for the audience to attend.

With that in mind, my team prioritises surfacing the respective information elegantly in order to entice potential the tedx attendance.

## Interaction and Art Direction

We extended the existing TED branding expressive potential by introducing the “bloom” motion language. The gentle staggering motion was to achieve a sense of organicity.

## Touchpoints

Working with the marketing team, the strategy maintained across multiple communication channels. Through these external artifects, curious individuals who see the topic are encouraged to discover content on the website.

## Testing & Interation

Before development, we ran a formative user research session on the prototype with 6 SFU students. We also asked a middle aged parent with visual impairment to participate with the intent of stress testing the system usability.
