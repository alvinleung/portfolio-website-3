## Microsite Design

As an online archive for the installation art pieces, the microsite intends to encapsulate the physical experience of the exhibition by creating a sense of immersion for visitors. It was achieve by:

<List>
  <ListItem label="1">
    Unique identity for each exhibit through visual and interaction design
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem label="2">Create intrigue through denial & reward. </ListItem>
</List>

## Interaction and Art Direction

We extended the existing TED branding expressive potential by introducing the “bloom” motion language. The gentle staggering motion was light and flowing, evokes motif of organic life.

## Touchpoints

Working with the marketing team, the strategy maintained across multiple communication channels. Through these external artifects, curious individuals who see the topic are encouraged to discover content on the website.

## Testing & Interation

Before development, we ran a formative user research session on the prototype with 6 SFU students. We also asked a middle aged parent with visual impairment to participate with the intent of stress testing the system usability.
