## Art Direction

To create a unique identity for the event, the team engaged in a deep graphic experimentation process. Taking inspiration from Ellen Lupton, Woflgang Weingart and Chris Ashworth, the process began with a thorough investigation of a set of design principles and qualities.

## Converging from 3 Directions

3 approaches emerged as a result of the experimentation. The approach I responsible for (digital distressing) was chosen for its cohesive use of the principles and the versatility across different media.

## Interaction Design
