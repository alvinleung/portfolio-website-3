## Celebrate the works

As an online archive for the installation art pieces, the microsite intends to encapsulate the physical experience of the exhibition by creating a sense of immersion for visitors. It was achieve by:

<List>
  <ListItem label="1">
    Unique identity for each exhibit through visual and interaction design
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem label="2">Create intrigue through denial & reward. </ListItem>

## Interactive Identity

Driven by a process that focuses on creating tangible artifacts, we iteratively explored interaction and motion possibilities that were afforded by the art direction.

After collecting and curating an extensive list of distortion techniques, hover interactions, animations, navigation, and methods of implementing dynamic grids, three distinct approaches was emerged as a way to surface content through interactivity.

## Experimental Approach to Art Direction

Taking inspiration from Ellen Lupton, Woflgang Weingart and Chris Ashworth, the process began with a thorough investigation of a set of design principles and qualities.
