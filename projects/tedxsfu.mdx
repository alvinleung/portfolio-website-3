-- TEDxSFU is an annual independently organised TED conference at Simon Fraser University. As the creative director of the 2021 iteration of the event, I was tasked with design and production of a microsite campaign to promote the event.

## Content Approach: A taste of the Conference

Through interviewing stakeholders, we found that speakers and their topics are the major motivating factor for the audience to attend. With that in mind, our content approach explores ways to surface that information to entice attendance.

As we found out that the users tend to be impatient with textual bio during user testing, the final microsite showcases a collection of suspenseful, fast-paced, trailer-style interviews. This lets the viewer sample the speaker's topic while getting to know themselves a little bit more in an engaging format.

## Expressive Interaction

We extended the existing TED branding expressive potential by introducing the “bloom” motion language. When tastefully applied, the gentle staggering motion soften the rather cold and precise modernist visuals.

## Touchpoints

The speaker-focused strategy was maintained across multiple communication channels. Through these external artifacts, curious individuals are encouraged to discover interview content on the website.

## Testing & Iteration

Before development, we ran a formative user research session on the prototype with 6 university students. We also asked a middle aged parent with visual impairment to participate with the intent of stress testing the system usability.

## Learnings and Takeaways

This is my first outside-of-class project that involve shipping a final product. Collaboration with development -> tight deadline, we have to roll out the design asynchronously to de-risk the development process.
