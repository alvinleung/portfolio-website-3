-- TEDxSFU is an annual independently organised ted conference at Simon Fraser University. As the creative director of the 2021 iteration of the event, I was tasked with design and production of a microsite campaign to promote the event.

## Attractors: Speaker and Topics

Through interviewing stakeholders, we found that speakers and their topics are the major motivating factor for the audience to attend. With that in mind, our _content design_ prioritises surfacing the respective information elegantly in order to entice potential the TEDx attendees.

## Expressive Interaction

We extended the existing TED branding expressive potential by introducing the “bloom” motion language. The gentle staggering motion soften the rather cold and precise modernist visual language. Resulting an elegance that evokes the feeling of.

## Touchpoints

The speaker-focused strategy was maintained across multiple communication channels. Through these external artifects, curious individuals are encouraged to discover interview content on the website.

## Testing & Iteration

Before development, we ran a formative user research session on the prototype with 6 SFU students. We also asked a middle aged parent with visual impairment to participate with the intent of stress testing the system usability.

## Learnings and Takeaways

This is my first outside-of-class project that involve shipping a final product. Collaboration with development -> tight deadline, we have to roll out the design asynchronously to de-risk the development process.
