-- TEDxSFU is an annual independently organised TED conference at Simon Fraser University. As the creative director of the 2021 iteration of the event, I was tasked with design and production of a microsite campaign to promote the event.

## A Taste of the Conference

Through interviewing stakeholders, we found that speakers and their topics are the major motivating factor for the audience to attend. With that in mind, our content and interaction design explores ways to surface that information in order to entice attendance.

Informed by user testing result, the microsite features a collection of suspenseful, fast-paced, trailer-style interviews. This allows the site visitors sample the speaker's topic while getting to know themselves a little bit more in an engaging format.

## Touchpoints

The speaker-focused strategy was maintained across multiple communication channels. Through these external artifacts, curious individuals are encouraged to discover interview content on the website.

## Expressive Interaction

We extended the existing TED branding expressive potential by introducing the “bloom” motion language. When tastefully applied, the gentle staggering motion soften the rather cold and precise modernist visuals.

## Testing & Iteration

Before development, I led a formative user research session on the prototype with 6 university students. The study also invited a middle aged parent with visual impairment to participate with the intent of stress testing the system usability.

## Learnings and Takeaways

We have to roll out the design asynchronously to de-risk the development process.

Devil is in the details, the nitty gritty of interaction could make or break an idea. The prototype failed to use the intuitive scrolling, to.
