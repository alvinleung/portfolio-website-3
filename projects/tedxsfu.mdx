-- TEDxSFU is an annual independently organised ted conference at Simon Fraser University. As the creative director of the 2021 iteration of the event, I was tasked with design and production of a microsite campaign to promote the event.

## Content Approach

Through interviewing stakeholders, we found that speakers and their topics are the major motivating factor for the audience to attend.

With that in mind, the team’s approach toward content prioritises surfacing the topics and speakers in order to entice potential the tedx attendance.

## Interaction and Art Direction

Working with the existing TED brand look and feel, we extended its expressive potential by introducing the “bloom” motion language. The gentle staggering motion was to achieve a sense of organicity.

## Touchpoints

Working with the marketing team, the strategy maintained across multiple communication channels. Through these external artifects, curious individuals who see the topic are encouraged to discover content on the website.

## Testing & Interation

To evaluate the design, we recruited 6 SFU students from different faculties. We also asked a middle aged parent with visual impairment to participate with the intent of stress testing the system usability.
