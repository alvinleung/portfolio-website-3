-- Modern home cooks rely heavily on digital recipes. Yet, amidst the sizzle and sweat, dirty hands makes navigating touch devices undesirable. This prototype-driven capstone project propose a multimodal interface for recipe navigation.

## A Sticky Situation

With popular cooking channels like Binging with Babish gaining over 10.1 million subscribers, the influence of online recipes is undeniable.

However during cooking, the pain of navigating such digital recipes—video or textural—with dirty hands is all too familiar. Slimy raw meat, dusty flour, there are million of things in the kitchen that makes you think twice before touching your devices.

Because of this, we see the oppoutinity to _challenge the dominant touch paradigm_ of modern mobile devices.

## Undersirable workarounds

To observe how homecooks navigate digital recipes, we conducted contextual inquiry with 5 participants with varying cooking proficiency. While users are generally able to complete the tasks through workarounds, the operations were less the desirable.

## Design principles

We explored air gesture as an interaction paradigm to

Cooking could be a cognitively intensive activity, recipe could put more to the strain.

Participants move around the kitchen, meaning they don’t necessarily has line of sight with the digital device — especially tablet.

## A multi-modal interaction proposal

Our solution uses a combination of voice and air gesture interaction to navigate the recipe. Together, they complement each other
